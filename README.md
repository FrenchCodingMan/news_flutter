## How I did this app

I USED FLUTTER DOCUMENTATION -- refleckt about UI, what i need to do and how i can do

# Architecture of App

Flutter use MVVM ( Model View View Model ) like SwiftUI for IOS developer.

Stateless Widget (static view) -- Statefull Widget (dynamic view) <br>


SingleChildScrollView list of Element)
At first i used local image before to use information of newsAPI

My main goal of this exercice is to use API , because it's my first time.


I USED NEWS API TO INSERT MY CONTENT. <br>
I USED A CAROUSEL SLIDER FOR THE BREAKING NEWS PART <br>
I USED ELEVATION TO GIVE A NICER PREVIEW FOR THE TRENDING NEWS. <br>

i'm stuck with appbundle to be able to publish my app on playstore <br>

I tried by read the line of the problem following by read flutter documentation (publish app playstore).
i asked StackOverFlow , Discord, ChatGPT <br>
